      The map method is a powerful function available on arrays in JavaScript. 
      It allows you to transform each element of an array and returns a new array with the transformed elements, 
      leaving the original array unchanged. It takes a callback function which is applied to every element, 
      providing an efficient and concise way to manipulate data.
